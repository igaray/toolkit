# Chanlist sorter
# Author: IÃ±aki Garay

# This script was written to sort a file containing the list of channels.
#
# To generate the input data in weechat, make sure it is logging, and request
# a list of all channels by issuing the command /list
# Extract the list from the logfile and save it in a text file.
# Pass the name of the text file as a parameter to this script, and the 
# name of the output file as the second parameter.
